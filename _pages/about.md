🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a first-year PhD Student at the NTU Singapore, School of Social Sciences.

📑 My overall research interests lies in interdisciplinary research in social sciences that combines human motivation with cyberpsychology and computational social science. 

📚 I'm currently working towards my PhD thesis that combines personality psychology and political psychology using mixed methods and computational social science.


## ⏳ My Background and History
I received my M.A. (by research) in Communications & New Media from the National University of Singapore, and my BSocSci (Hons) in Psychology and Media Analytics from the Nanyang Technological University Singapore. Prior to commencing my university education, I had a short stint as a Human Resources Executive after gaining a Diploma in Business Studies, specialising in Human Capital Management.
